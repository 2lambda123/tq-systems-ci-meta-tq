-----------------

Clone this repo using git clone --recurse-submodules <url>

When switching branches keep in mind to keep the submodules in sync.

To help setting up an initial build space, use 

$: MACHINE=tqma6q-mba6 source setup-environment <build directory>

After this step, everything is setup to build an image using bitbake.
To use a shared download directory, you can provice $DL_DIR inside
~/.yocto/site.conf. This will automatically symlinked in the conf dir
of the build space.
