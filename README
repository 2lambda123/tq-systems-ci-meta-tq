Quick Start Guide
-----------------

Clone this repo using git clone --recurse-submodules <url>

When switching branches keep in mind to keep the submodules in sync.

To help setting up an initial build space, use

$: MACHINE=<machine> source setup-environment <build directory>

After this step, everything is setup to build an image using bitbake.
To use a shared download directory, you can provice $DL_DIR inside
~/.yocto/site.conf. This will automatically symlinked in the conf dir
of the build space.

TODO: 
- use dynamic-layers in meta-tq to allow integration of modified
recipes from meta-ti
- allow build without meta-ti
- fix setup scripts
- test and adopt jenkins support
