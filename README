TQ ARM modules Yocto integration test
=====================================

Supported boards
----------------

see README of TQ Sytems layer (meta-tq) or use ./ls-machines

Quick Start Guide
-----------------

Clone this repo using git clone --branch=<branch-name> --recurse-submodules <url>

current supported branches:
- krogoth
- morty
- pyro
- rocko (currently no i.MX mfgtool support)

branch names correspond to yocto release names

When switching branches keep in mind to keep the submodules in sync:

git submodule sync
git submodule update --init

To list supported machines:

./ls-machines

To help setting up an initial build space, use

export MACHINE=<machine> && source setup-environment <builddir> <config>

where config is: minimal | gui | mfgtool | network

This will use sources/template/conf/bblayers.conf.<config> as initial template
for your layer configuration. Additionally some config variables are injected:

MACHINE: default tqma6q-mba6x or value from environment
SDKMACHINE: default i686 or value from environment
DISTRO: default poky  or value from environment

In case you have ~/.oe or ~/.yocto dir a site.conf file will be symlinked to
the conf dir of the buildir to allow machine specific overrrides. For instance 
to use a shared download directory, you can provide $DL_DIR via ~/.yocto/site.conf.

Internally the oe-init-build-env script from the
used openembedded / poky meta layer will be sourced.

After this step, everything is setup to build an image using bitbake.

To force a build of all supported machines in one of the configs, one can
use the CI helper script:

ci/build-all <builddir> <config>

depending on the selected config, the following will be built:

minimal:	tq-image-generic (from meta-dumpling, depends on core-image-minimal)
gui:		fsl-image-multimedia-full (meta-freescale-distro)
mfgtool:	fsl-image-mfgtool-initramfs (meta-freescale)
network:	tq-image-network (from meta-dumpling, depends on fsl-image-networking)

Note, that not all machines will be built in all configurations. Exclusions can
be found in ci/build-all script.

To help to create a package mirror, one can use the CI helper script:

ci/build-all <builddir> <config> mirror

and define the following stuff in your site.conf:

SOURCE_MIRROR_URL ?= "file://<full path>/"
INHERIT += "own-mirrors"

PREMIRRORS_prepend = "\
        git://.*/.* file://full path>/ \n \
        ftp://.*/.* file://full path>/ \n \
        http://.*/.* file://full path>/ \n \
        https://.*/.* file://full path>/ \n \
        "

To fill the mirror, the script 
- allows to create also tarballs from SCM using BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS=1 
- forces downloads for uninative packages by INHERIT_remove = \"uninative\""
- copies all archives from DL_DIR to the mirror

This way the mirror can be used to do offline builds without downloading anything
with BB_FETCH_PREMIRRORONLY=1
